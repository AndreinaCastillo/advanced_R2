<!-- ## R Markdown -->
<!-- hello!!!!!!!! -->
<!-- This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. -->

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r dat, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->



```{r final, echo=FALSE}
#Load file and select data for three countries (Guam, Norway, Germany)

dat <- read.csv("data/gapminder.csv",header=TRUE)
#head(dat)
#summary(dat)
#str(dat) #Str ==> structure NOT string

#Plots year vs.GDP

country_select <- function(countries){
  for (countr in countries){
    country_subset <- subset(dat, dat$country == countr)
    #print(country_subset)
    plot(country_subset$year,country_subset$gdpPercap,ylab = "GDP", xlab= "Year", main= countr)
  }
}

countries <- c("Norway","Japan","Chad")

country_select(countries)



```



They look the same cause they all make da monies. Except Chad, nobody likes Chad, and they have no oil.


```{r final2}
funsies <- levels(dat$continent)
continent_LifeExp <- function(funsies){
  for(f in funsies){
    continent_subset <- subset(dat, dat$continent == f)
    out<-c("Mean_is" = mean(continent_subset$lifeExp),
           "Max_is" = max(continent_subset$lifeExp),
           "Min_is" = min(continent_subset$lifeExp))
    
    print(f)
    print(out)
  }
 
}

continent_LifeExp(funsies)
```


This further supports the hypothesis that nobody likes Chad.

```{r final3}
#make histograms of global lifExp

hist(dat$lifeExp, xlab = "Life Expectancies", main ="Histogram of life Expectancies (including Chad)")

hist(dat$lifeExp, xlab = "Life Expectancies", 
     main ="Histogram of life Expectancies (including Chad)", breaks = 50)

```
